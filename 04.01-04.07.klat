[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:49:10 "I'm still glad I left"
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:49:43 "I loved the people I worked for (the residents of the retirement community, not the managers)"
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:50:04 "But I still think it was the best move for me to have left when I did. I was there for almost 6 years."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:51:26 ":) Yeah"
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:51:41 "I do hate job hunting, though"

[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:52:16 "Yeah. I had several good friends die without me knowing, then I would find out a week later."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:52:56 "The hardest was when the coolest person there (biker chick, always smiling, great jokes) lost her husband... and her smile."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:53:12 "That was heartbreaking to see."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:53:39 "Yeah, that's why I didn't like the management. Plus, the fact that we changed managers every few months."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:55:10 "Yeah."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:55:41 "I'd just been there too long. I liked the fact that I new more of the little things than the management did. Lol"
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:56:05 "yeah..."
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:56:33 "Anyway, I should probably get off for now. I'm probably going to get a call in the next few minutes! :)"
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:56:48 "Thanks!"
[Shout] Tue 04.03 12:56:58 "See y'all later!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:04:04 "Hiya"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:04:23 "No one's here, are they? It's not even that late!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:12:18 "I know!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:12:27 "It is sad..."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:14:14 "Yay!!"

[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:20:15 "I'm noticing some very new things. LOL"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:21:48 "Loki, the Tesesract, and Thor's astrophysicist."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:21:54 "Hiya shan!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:22:02 "WTF is his name?"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:22:07 "help."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:23:35 "Oh, just the way they set it up from the earlier movies. I'm recognizing them all in new ways."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:23:45 "That's so sad, Shan!!!!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:23:53 "You are missing out!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:25:14 "What order are you thinking of?"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:26:10 "Most of?"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:26:39 "Oh LOL"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:28:05 "The only decent DC"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:28:29 "The only decent thing DC has done beside Green Lantern"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:28:52 "Superman is DC, Spiderman is Marvel"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:29:11 "Hell yeah"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:30:08 "yeah, I like Thor a lot"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:30:17 "He's kind of ridiculous. :P"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:30:30 "Do you mean Homecoming or another one?"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:30:45 "Yeah, Thor is ridiculous! In a funny/good way."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:31:56 "You ought to see Tom Holland. Blows Toby Maguire out of the water."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:32:04 "Movie poor? You're crazy."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:32:52 "I was never a big fan of Spiderman, though."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:33:55 "Definitely!"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:34:34 "I've heard that said... I've never quite seen the perspective."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:34:40 "XD"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:35:00 "Or do you mean just too many Spiderman movies?"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:37:20 "XD"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:40:59 "Yeah... marvel's is actually connected to something, though"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:41:13 "Not so much rebooting for the sake of it anymore."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:41:32 "I never cared until now."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:42:47 "lol I have mixed feelings on it.."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:42:57 "Oh, how is it??"

[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:46:54 "I know... I kind of hope to be a part of creating something like that some day."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:47:13 "And being a part of it."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:48:26 "Yeah... the world now has that too"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:49:58 "I'd love the freedom to put on whatever skin I wanted. Something that reflects my mind, not just my frame I'm stuck with."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:51:07 "Yeah..."
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:51:58 "Lol Yeah"
[Shout] Thu 04.05 23:52:04 "Wings."
