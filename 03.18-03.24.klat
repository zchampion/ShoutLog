[Shout] Mon 03.19 12:39:34 "XD"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 12:39:42 "Really?"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 12:45:18 "This is stuck in my head and I can't figure out why:"

[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:08:38 "Well, no, that's not where I got it."
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:09:09 "Your full name was in the google photos link you shared just a minute ago. I googled it."
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:09:28 "Adann's dossier?? Whaat?"

[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:20:55 "Ah, you found it!"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:21:07 "Yeah, that seemed super sketch to me"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:21:22 "At least you have a good reputation score, eh?  XD"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:25:12 "Lol Katharine"

[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:51:59 "Oh sorry! Yeah, that's amazon"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:52:11 "The link is the same, though"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:52:23 "as the one I posted earlier, I mean"
[Shout] Mon 03.19 14:52:30 "Oh, yeah, that's true."

[Shout] Wed 03.21 22:28:27 "Hey all."
[Shout] Wed 03.21 22:28:41 "I love that that's called Mechanical turk. XD"
[Shout] Wed 03.21 22:28:53 "You know that was a real thing, right?"

[Shout] Wed 03.21 23:50:21 "I got some stuff done today."
[Shout] Wed 03.21 23:50:29 "I applied for like 8 jobs."
[Shout] Wed 03.21 23:50:36 "Finally. LOL"
[Shout] Wed 03.21 23:51:15 "I had a skill test for that one. Still waiting on word, though."

[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:06:57 "Sorry, adann. :P"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:08:33 "social media kinda sucks, though"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:09:16 "Yeah"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:09:29 "By and large, I just don't like people. XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:10:08 "Lol Yeah, it's a great place to people-waatch"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:10:13 "XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:14:07 "with fluffy what?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:16:01 "Thank you, dear. Lol"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:17:29 "lol I'm still the baby"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:19:29 "Yeah, I hear you."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:19:39 "I'm never quite sure how to use it."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:19:53 "LOL"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:21:18 "that would certainly be an interesting transition to watch"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:21:26 "I'm almost jealous."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:22:29 "Yeah, I want to use it like that, I just never think that people want to see that shit from me"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:24:20 "yeah, it took me a while to understand you, adann. Lol"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:24:30 "I'm with you now, though, you know"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:24:40 "haha"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:25:41 "ha. Be yourself, eh?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:25:56 "So easy to say, so much harder to do than people realize."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:34:19 "Getting to return them at the end of the day is pretty nice, eh? Lol"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:34:27 "haha"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:34:40 "I would hate that so much personally"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:34:58 "I couldn't deal with kids even when I was one."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:35:04 "Oh jeez"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:35:13 "That must have been fun"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:35:36 "I didn't even want to deal with my own family. XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:35:44 "I bet it did"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:35:53 "Right..."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:36:18 "Yeah, no kidding"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:36:36 "That... was not supposed to be a pun"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:41:24 "I worry about that... Some people surely know themselves, but most..."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:41:38 "Most usually really don't"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:42:03 "Yeah, me too, Katharine."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:43:19 "I'm astonished at even that, adann. I have no idea how to even have a basic understanding of myself."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:43:37 "I've learned that I can't define myself by nouns."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:44:03 "It's not that I am something, it's that I do or like something."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:44:26 "XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:44:36 "That was very confusing"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:44:57 "I'm not a fuck up, I fucked up. LOL You know?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 00:45:24 "Okay, now I'm really confused."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:17:56 "XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:18:03 "*your"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:18:10 "LMFAO"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:18:27 "Well, I think I may have just dissed myself."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:18:33 "Okay, then"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:19:49 "Kitty! hi"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:20:00 "That sucks"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:20:59 "Yeah, Katharine, I bet you're right"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:21:07 "Usually are, anyway."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 01:32:08 "Yeah, and my computer is almost running low on battery"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:02:03 "Hey Erika!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:02:25 "Still here?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:02:56 "Pretty good! Just getting the day started."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:03:09 "lol I guess I had good timing, then. XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:03:21 "Glad I caught you! It's been a while."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:03:34 "Have you had food yet today?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:03:55 "Yeah, I was the same way when I had an early job. :/"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:04:11 "maybe you should eat if you haven't in a while"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:04:26 "Oh, bah. The cookies were good for your mind. :P"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:04:35 "Really? That's interesting!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:05:02 "It happens to me a lot that I feel tired or spacey and usually just need to eat."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:05:13 "Very strange!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:06:36 "oh yeah, that's usually when I need to eat, personally. Lol"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:06:49 "It usually makes me think, "caffeine!" XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:07:19 "It took me a long time to figure out that that feeling meant hunger. lol"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:07:25 "Oh, really?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:07:40 "Lol The muse never comes until you start."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:07:59 "I know! I always thought it was supposed to be obvious, but it's really not..."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:08:38 "Oh, yeah. I just mean "muse" as in the ability to feel like I can actually do a thing."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:09:01 "It never comes for me until I'm already in the middle of it. Haha"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:09:15 "That happens sometimes, too!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:10:50 "Oh, no! I'm sorry"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:11:10 "I'm totally the opposite - motivation levels slowly build through the day."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:11:18 "Oh, good morning, dear!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:11:34 "She is sneaky...."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:14:33 "I bet you're right!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:15:06 "Honestly, though, I think that could be true no matter what line of work you're in."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:16:11 "Yeah..."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:16:32 "I still wonder how I'm going to deal with that..."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:17:42 "XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:17:58 "yeah, no kidding! People are demanding."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:18:18 "<3 And you're so good at it!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:28:11 "lol they hinted at offering her a position like that a little while ago, actually."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:28:18 "At a panel she did."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:31:19 "Yeah, you have no idea. XD"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:31:29 "Oh, that's right."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:31:40 "Pish."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:32:06 "Which is less glib than it may sound."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:32:24 "(not sure if glib is the right word for that...)"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:41:14 "We should get going to the barn, though..."
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:41:20 "LOL"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:41:32 "Good to see you, Erika!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:41:39 "Lol Thanks!"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 12:41:47 "See you later. :)"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 23:56:29 "Anyone still here?"
[Shout] Thu 03.22 23:56:52 "I guess it's quite late, isn't it?"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:54:25 "Hi Villon & Heidi!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:54:40 "I was super sad I missed you last night, Heidi!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:54:52 "How are you doing, Villon? :)"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:55:51 "I've missed you! You weren't on last night, though.. :P"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:56:23 "How's it going? :)"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:56:31 "What?"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:56:49 "Oh no! Weird why?"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:58:04 "I wasn't pretending, though! T.T"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:58:22 "Oh, wow, Heidi. And that sounds like it was just the start, wasn't it?"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 12:58:45 "Oh no!!!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:00:05 "The next day being yesterday?"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:00:18 "Oh, man! No wonder that was weird. :("
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:00:31 "Oh, gotcha!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:00:47 "Oh, no! You had to cancel on your client after all? :(("
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:01:17 "Holy crap, heidi!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:01:35 "I'm super glad you weren't!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:10:02 "My gosh, Heidi. May you have many happy things today!!"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:10:11 "Sorry I got distracted."

[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:17:42 "What's that second one?"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:18:21 "Yeah, you can just press it once for a 1-minute timer, twice for a 3 minute timer... etc."
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:18:31 "Oh, it's easier than a phone! XD"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:18:37 "XD"
[Shout] Fri 03.23 13:18:53 "I'm really glad I don't have the plastic one... I hate that feeling."
