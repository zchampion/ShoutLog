[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:20:53 "sic?"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:20:58 "why the sic?"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:21:16 "i don't think it means what you think it means..."
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:22:11 "the latin adverb sic ("thus", "just as"; in full: sic erat scriptum, "thus was it written") inserted after a quoted word or passage indicates that the quoted matter has been transcribed or translated exactly as found in the source text"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:22:18 "hi heidi!"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:22:52 "hi holly :)"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:23:14 "lol"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:23:22 "that's not what it means"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:23:31 "kind of the opposite, actually"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:26:04 "it doesn't if he's quoting himself though. he said he was using it to communicate uncertainty. sic denotes certainty. it says, "trust us, this is how we meant to write this word""
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:26:10 "lol"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:26:23 "brb"

[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:29:25 "katharine backs me up from the couch! xd"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:30:24 "i don't..."
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:30:37 "i've lost track of everything now"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:30:56 "that sounds like a good idea, holly"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:31:05 "i'm sorry it's not working out, though... :("
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:31:31 "lol that makes me twitch a little bit. xd"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:31:56 "that kind of thing, i find, is when i learn the most, but i only realize what it is i'm learning at the end."
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:35:25 "yikes. "
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:42:03 "holly, that's how i've felt at my job for months. lol"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:58:16 "wait, oracle?"
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:58:30 "i don't think the oracle i'm thinking of is the right one."
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:58:50 "the ones i'm thinking of make one of the biggest programming languages..."
[Shout] Sun 09.02 18:59:02 "(read that as pain in the a$$)"
