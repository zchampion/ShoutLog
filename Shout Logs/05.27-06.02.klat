[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:35:32 "xd yes omg"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:36:35 "for a man composed entirely of steel, colossus is strangely attractive. "
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:40:24 "xd"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:40:37 "was it more than just the once in the manor?"

[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:42:28 "yeah, him standing outside colossus' window with the boombox phone case. xd"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:43:03 "it was probably actually playing over the taxi's speakers, come to think of it."
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:43:17 "i was thinking at the time that a phone wouldn't play that loud."
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:44:27 "xd"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:44:42 "i don't think it lessens anything for the record.... :p"

[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:47:47 "xd"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:49:25 "but it sounds like a really interesting premise."
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:54:21 "i remember thinking that i really needed to see it, but it came out when i graduated high school, so i don't remember when i would have come across it."
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:54:47 "probably someone mentioned it like you just did, i looked it up like i just did, and then forgot..."
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:55:26 "the cycle continues..."
[Shout] Tue 05.29 00:58:24 "anyway"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 01:16:22 "did you go to bed, renee?"
[Shout] Tue 05.29 01:16:32 "i just realized how very late it is..."
