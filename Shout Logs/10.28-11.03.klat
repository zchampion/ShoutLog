[Shout] Sun 10.28 23:51:28 "okay. say hi to him for me!"
[Shout] Sun 10.28 23:51:35 "goodnight!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:50:35 "i mean, it's not the way the term is used, though"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:50:55 "i disagree"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:51:06 "lol hi katharine!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:51:21 "lol okay, holly! roger that!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:52:09 "the day of your birth, yes. i think the term 'birthday' means the celebration of that day, not the actual day. usually, at least"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:52:45 "lol"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:53:03 "exactly!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:53:35 "no it's not"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:53:56 "no, she's not."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:54:08 "'birthday' is the celebration of that day."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:54:15 "not the actual day."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:54:42 "just as anniversaries are celebrations of the day you start dating someone."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:54:55 "it is almost exactly the same thing"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:56:48 "most of the time, when a form is asking for the year, it says date of birth"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:56:58 "shay, don't be condescending"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:57:36 "shay, seriously"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:58:14 "i'm sorry, what?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:58:25 "you have ceased to make sense."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 20:58:34 "lol sorry"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:01:14 "all i'm saying is... the term you're using is the anniversary"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:01:24 "so it's your 22nd birthday"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:01:38 "i did."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:01:52 "the primary definition means the anniversary"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:02:02 "no"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:02:51 "2/3 definitions say the anniversary and even the 2nd one that you're citing uses a sentence that doesn't usually include the year"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:03:27 "it's an illogical conclusion, shay"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:03:49 "yes, it is."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:04:04 "shall we continue or can we talk about something real?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:04:20 "we bloody well know what you're saying."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:05:02 "why are you ignoring the other two definitions entirely?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:05:45 "because this isn't fun and he's being condescending"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:06:22 "a word doesn't mean more than one thing when it's used."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:06:35 "independently, yes. but not when it's used."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:07:09 "it's rude, holly"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:07:18 "yes, can we?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:11:02 "goodnight, kitty!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:12:39 "i need some tea. brb"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:22:42 "yeah, that's awesome, shay! congrats!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:23:10 ":)"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:24:58 "that's always a great position to be in. :)"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:26:52 ":o"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:27:02 "heck yeah! :d"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:31:10 "hiya shan!"

[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:39:02 "wait, who is winston?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:39:12 "sorry, i've forgotten"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:39:56 "this is who i think of when you say winston:"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:40:03 "oh, okay!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:40:13 "and okay, darling! <3"

[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:57:53 "well, shan's friend's cat. not katharine's cat."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:58:15 "you're fine!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:58:39 "oh?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:58:52 "i've gotten very confused."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:59:22 "oh, okay! not winston."
[Shout] Tue 10.30 21:59:31 "sorry shan!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:00:33 "that definitely sounds like a good sign. :)"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:01:49 "yeah, that's a really scary thought"

[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:14:16 "national novel wrtiting month starts tomorrow night (after midnight) and i'm mildly terrified. :p"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:14:35 "yeah!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:14:53 "it's come far far too soon!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:15:11 "the rest of the year simply vanished"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:17:28 "krystal, what happened with your nanowrimo?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:17:43 "are you going to try again this year?"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:17:53 "impossible to fail with nano!!"
[Shout] Tue 10.30 22:18:04 "that's the whole point of it, you know. :)"

[Bug] 5.00 Wed 10.31 11:51:11 "A couple of shouts after I put an image in the chat, the shout box went from a couple of lines tall as it usually is to a single line tall. It did look good and it didn't impede shouting, so I didn't think anything of it at the time. After I accidentally expanded it again and hid it after, the shout box disappeared entirely. Pictures of the end state are attached - I can expand the shouting options and see the shout box or hide it and the shout box goes away."

[Shout] Thu 11.01 20:39:52 "sometimes, i would rather pay the fine and finish the book. :/"
[Shout] Thu 11.01 20:40:10 "or because i can't renew it because others have holds on it."
[Shout] Thu 11.01 20:40:18 "which is usually the case"
