[Shout] Sun 05.20 19:21:52 "most of the employers i've talked to are pretty flexible."
[Shout] Sun 05.20 19:22:11 "but the class in the fall is pretty close to evening, so it's easier."
[Shout] Sun 05.20 19:22:26 "dish will actually help pay for my classes if i get that job."
[Shout] Sun 05.20 19:23:12 "i did that already. i'm getting impatient and i can work around the classes i have left, so i really want to."
[Shout] Sun 05.20 19:23:26 "one class per semester is nothing, really. lol"

[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:24:49 "it's just fun to say. :p"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:25:18 "although it'd be even better if we could say "hela" as an adjective"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:25:30 "as in the norse goddess of death"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:25:49 "cause then we could say something was "hella hela." :p"

[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:42:13 "lol holly"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:42:53 "i really don't..."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:43:05 "i don't like sleep. it feels like wasted time to me."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:43:35 "it's a bit unfortunate that i need it to function. lol"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:44:04 "lol yeah, that would be weird."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:44:16 "do you ever just stay up at that point?"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:44:30 "or do you usually try to go back to sleep?"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:45:18 "yeah, most of the time i just feel awful instead of refreshed."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:46:23 "i've heard that a good way to do it is to have caffeine and then take a 30-minute nap."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:46:41 "the caffeine takes effect around when you wake up or something."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:47:08 "lol holly!"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:47:25 "it probably effects everyone differently, though..."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:47:43 "*affects"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:48:00 "idk"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:49:41 "lol i can do that too, krystal."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:50:04 "caffeine helps me focus and that, i think, is actually what helps me feel awake."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:50:22 "just being able to focus on something, and i can stay awake for a while."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:50:29 "why, holly?"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:51:13 "lol shan"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:51:24 "like the crash afterward, holly?"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:52:00 "that kind of thing is why i avoid mtn. dew now."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:52:05 "i see."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:53:21 "huh"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:54:00 "coffee i'll only do if i don't have time for tea."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:54:23 "tea is something i can ground myself with. it doesn't even have to be caffeine."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:55:09 "lol me too"
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:55:20 "i'm so bad about forgetting to eat most days."
[Shout] Mon 05.21 23:55:27 "so bad."

[Shout] Tue 05.22 12:29:31 "that's very sad."
[Shout] Tue 05.22 12:29:45 "usually that goes away on its own."
[Shout] Tue 05.22 12:30:12 "i don't know about you, but caffeine doesn't directly wake me up anyway. "
[Shout] Tue 05.22 12:32:15 "i guess today's just one of those other days, eh?"
