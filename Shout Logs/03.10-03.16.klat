[Shout] Sun 03.10 12:46:34 "It's still morning for you, isn't it?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 12:46:45 "For another like 15 minutes? lol"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 12:49:19 "Ah! You're in the other direction from me. Forgive me; I forgot."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 12:49:27 "Well, how's the afternoon going?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 12:54:45 "Oops! Didn't realize the time - gotta go make lunch."

[Shout] Sun 03.10 12:54:53 "Hi Kitty!"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:08:20 "How's it all going for you, Kitty?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:17:51 "Oh no! What's going on?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:24:53 "Oh, I understand. I wish I could help. :("
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:25:05 "Yeah, I'm working on some personal projects. It feels fantastic."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:25:20 "It's been way too long since I've worked on this project."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:26:29 ":)"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:26:34 "yeah"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:27:11 "Have you heard a lot about the new Captain Marvel movie?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:30:48 "No, not yet"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:30:57 "I've been avoiding news about it, too XD"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:31:09 "Gotta run, though. I'll be on in a little bit."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 13:31:15 "TTFN! :)"

[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:21:40 "Bahahaha"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:21:46 "Sorry, though, Kitty"

[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:23:41 "lol"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:31:00 ":/"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:31:03 "That does suck"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:31:17 "I'm thinking about making some tea for the same reason"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:31:20 "I'm thinking about making some tea for the same reason"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:33:15 "Oops. Lol Sorry about that double"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:33:27 "I wouldn't be able to help you with the bean people, though..."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:33:42 "That might end up going to some slightly celestial realms..."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:34:30 "I suppose they might be."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:34:36 "Isn't that a regulation somewhere?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:34:52 "I'm pretty sure I read that at the BBB one time."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:35:18 "Drat"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:35:30 "That might put a whole hole in plans."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:37:20 "No, the plants of South America."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:37:55 "That seems like the weak way out of an Indiana Jones adventure."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:38:15 "What if Henry Jones Jr. had just said, "I'll have a second cup?""
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:38:23 "Nothing would have changed in the movies!"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:38:44 "That seems like a fair rate."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:39:33 "You have some beans, though, right?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:39:43 "Kitty's right. ^^"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:41:40 ":O"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:41:50 "You'd better have that second cup, God"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:41:56 "You're going to need it"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:59:32 "LOL"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 15:59:46 "That does seem like it could be a bit alarming"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:25:06 "Hey Adann"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:25:11 "How's it going?"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:25:24 "Good. Just working on stuff"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:25:30 "I saw your status on fb!"

[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:28:49 "lol Yep. That's their pattern"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:31:18 "Yeah, I hear you"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:31:22 "That sucks"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:32:49 "Oh no!!!"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:32:56 "I'm so sorry to hear it :("
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:33:27 "Yeah... :("
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:36:14 "Well, that's quite the interruption to your routine, so I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of the hard time is because of that"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:38:59 "lol"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:39:20 "That's a terrible affliction."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 16:44:52 "Yeah..."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 17:46:39 "Sorry I disappeared."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 17:46:42 "I took a nap."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 17:46:50 "It was lovely."
[Shout] Sun 03.10 20:11:11 "Hey"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 20:11:22 "Yes! I support this plan"
[Shout] Sun 03.10 20:11:36 "He should work at the Starbucks. :3"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 11:45:08 "That sounds like it's somewhere in northern Africa XD"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 11:46:02 "Nevermind, this is where it is:"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 11:46:06 "Switzerland"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:29:20 "Hey guys"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:31:28 "Ooh that looks good!"

[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:35:43 "I mean that you're hungry LOL"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:37:45 "That sounds good"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:37:58 "What's happening with the cat, though?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:38:05 "Why do you have to pick them up?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:39:13 "Wait, Katharine, do you know what they are?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:39:18 "Hi Heidi!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:39:31 "Lol"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:39:33 "Nice"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:41:19 "Lol gotcha"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:43:19 "Agh. I really need to update my resume"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:43:29 "I'm pretty sure, actually, that I will need to as a part of my class"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:43:46 "Same!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:46:29 "No, kitty, I was just thinking that it's a good idea to update my resume as I use the skills. It'll be a lot easier, I'm sure, to remember what skills I'm using now instead of trying to figure it out later."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:46:39 "I'd like to start updating my resume every six months or so to make that easy"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:46:47 "Ideally anyway..."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:47:51 "Lol"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:48:31 "And that way, you don't have to be put together to have it ready ;)"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:49:06 "Nice :)"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:50:18 "That sounds good, dear!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:54:20 "Ah yes!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:54:22 "LOL"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:54:35 "Otherwise the rest of it is going to be kind of hard"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 19:56:54 "Lol"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:10:29 "That sounds about right &gt;:("
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:11:17 "Why is that?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:13:51 "Wow, that's a seriously sucky situation"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:15:49 "would that be enough to compensate for the downgrade, though?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:16:29 "It'd be nice if she could get someone else lined up to move in and kick the ungrateful - out..."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:16:56 "Lol Heidi"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:17:02 "Sure, Renee!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:17:33 "Lol"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:18:37 "Lol"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:20:37 "That doesn't seem like the typical incentive?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:21:02 "Hahaha Indeed. :P"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:24:26 "I'm thinking about putting on&nbsp;<em>﻿Infinity War</em>﻿ and going to work on my bed..."

[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:25:05 "They'll give it back in the fall..."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:25:10 "XD"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:25:25 "I totally forgot about that, Heidi"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:25:28 "XD"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:26:33 "..."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 20:26:37 "Whai?"

[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:16:43 "Gah"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:18:30 "That sounds so good!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:19:49 "Yeah, Katharine &amp; I had an instant mashed potato yesterday that had cauliflower in it"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:19:55 "That was really good"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:23:28 "Nice :)"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:23:48 "I was kind of wary of them at first."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:27:31 "Yeah..."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:28:20 "I think I'm going to get off for a bit. I gotta clean up my dishes from dinner and then my friend and I are going to game for a bit."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:28:45 "Seriously?"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:28:47 "Wow!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:29:03 "Actually, not just yet."

[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:30:10 "That is a&nbsp;<em>﻿lot of cheese</em>"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:30:45 "Oh, gotcha"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:30:59 "I was picturing something bigger, I guess. LOL"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:31:07 "Yeah"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:31:29 "Looks like you need a&nbsp;<em>﻿serious</em>﻿ quantity of cheese"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:32:16 "That's good! ^_^"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:33:10 "Oh! I didn't know that happened to tortillas, tbh."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:33:24 "I mean I didn't know you could refresh them, I should say"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:34:45 "Hey!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:34:48 ":)"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:36:41 "Not much. I'm just getting some refreshment."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:36:45 ":)"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:41:40 "LOL"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:43:03 "That's what the enchiladas are, though. At least partially"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:43:18 "Or I guess I don't know if they're tomorrow."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:43:23 "They're later, though"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:43:37 "Man, my keyboard is supposed to be quieter..."
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:43:43 "It's not that quiet"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:43:50 "LOL"

[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:49:43 "I forgot about starbucks!"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:52:39 "lol"
[Shout] Mon 03.11 21:52:54 "Alright, I'm going to get off and game a bit with my friend."

[Shout] Tue 03.12 11:01:06 "How's it going for you?"
[Shout] Tue 03.12 11:01:16 "Man, sorry. I got sucked into troubleshooting bs."

[Shout] Tue 03.12 11:01:25 "ugh"
[Shout] Tue 03.12 11:09:10 "It's... not&nbsp;<em>﻿not</em>﻿ going well... but it's not really going well."
[Shout] Tue 03.12 11:11:57 "No matter what I do, though... nothing new happens. But the only other thing I can think of is intimidating."
